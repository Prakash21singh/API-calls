# API-calls
This is a little project about API handling ,
Basically what i've done here is fetching an api based on another API,
i used Two APIs here , 1.Random user API and 2. REST countries so i fetch some datas from random user api,extract country from it and passed it to REST countries to get details about his/her country...............and that's all. Thank you
